Hello and welcome!

I am a postdoctoral research scientist in biostatistics at Columbia University in the City of New York, where I am honored to work with [Professor Yuanjia Wang](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/profile/yuanjia-wang-phd) and [Professor Annie J. Lee](https://www.neurology.columbia.edu/profile/annie-j-lee-phd). I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from Simon Fraser University, where I was grateful to be advised by [Professor Jiguo Cao](https://www.sfu.ca/science/stat/cao/). Earlier, I earned my master's degree in Statistics from the University of British Columbia, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Professor Jiahua Chen](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/jiahua-chen).

I am broadly interested in the theoretical and methodological aspects of statistics and machine learning. My current research focuses on methodological challenges motivated by neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, I develop novel statistical and machine learning approaches to characterize disease heterogeneity—such as in Alzheimer’s disease—by integrating high-dimensional multi-omics data with longitudinal clinical trajectories.
